Click "New Event" button
Shows an empty form (I added the event id after the "#" in the top of the form)
Fill "Event Title" with "A"
Press "Submit"
The form desapears and a new event by title "A" is added to the list
Press "New Event" again
The event "A", just registered, is shown !

(In the console it can be seen that the event.Id is null, as should be, all the time...)





 if (this.props.selectedEvent.id !== null) {
      console.log(
        "(componentDidMount):",
        "NOT null !!!",
        this.props.selectedEvent
      );
      this.setState({
        event: this.props.selectedEvent
      });
    } else {
      // added ELSE...
      console.log(
        "(componentDidMount):",
        "is null !!!",
        this.props.selectedEvent
      );
      this.setState({
        event: emptyEvent
      });
    }
